# Module 1: JavaScript Exercises Solutions

This directory contains module 1 various JavaScript exercises aimed at enhancing understanding of programming concepts through practical examples. The exercises are organized into two folders: `program-structure` and `functions`.

## Features

- **Program Structure Exercises**: Demonstrate fundamental programming constructs like loops and conditionals.
- **Functions Exercises**: Explore function creation, recursion, and character counting.

## Folder Overview

### Program Structure

The `program-structure` folder includes exercises that illustrate basic programming structures through simple output generation:

- **[Looping Triangle Exercise](https://github.com/CNwante/Solomon-Nwante-Web3-Course/blob/main/module-1/program-structure/looping-a-triangle.js)**: This exercise uses nested loops to create a triangle of `#` symbols. The outer loop controls the number of rows, while the inner loop constructs each row by concatenating `#` symbols.

- **[FizzBuzz Exercise](https://github.com/CNwante/Solomon-Nwante-Web3-Course/blob/main/module-1/program-structure/fizzbuzz.js)**: A classic programming challenge that prints numbers from 1 to 100, but for multiples of three, it prints "Fizz," for multiples of five, it prints "Buzz," and for numbers that are multiples of both, it prints "FizzBuzz."

- **[ChessBoard Exercise](https://github.com/CNwante/Solomon-Nwante-Web3-Course/blob/main/module-1/program-structure/chessboard.js)**: This exercise generates an 8x8 chessboard pattern using nested loops. It alternates between spaces and `#` symbols based on the sum of the row and column indices.

### Functions

The `functions` folder contains exercises focused on function creation and recursion:

- **[Minimum Exercise](https://github.com/CNwante/Solomon-Nwante-Web3-Course/blob/main/module-1/functions/minimum.js)**: Implements a simple function to determine the minimum of two numbers, showcasing conditional logic in function design.

- **[Recursion Exercise](https://github.com/CNwante/Solomon-Nwante-Web3-Course/blob/main/module-1/functions/recursion.js)**: This exercise illustrates the concept of recursion by determining if a number is even. It handles negative input with an error message and uses recursion to reduce the number until it reaches a base case.

- **[Bean Counting Exercise](https://github.com/CNwante/Solomon-Nwante-Web3-Course/blob/main/module-1/functions/bean-counting.js)**: Contains two functions: `countBs`, which counts the number of `B`s in a string, and `countChar`, a more generalized function that counts occurrences of any specified character.

## How to Use

1. Clone this directory to your local machine.
2. Navigate to the `program-structure` or `functions` folder to explore the respective exercises.
3. Run the JavaScript files in a compatible environment (e.g., a web browser console or Node.js) to see the output and understand the logic.

## Conclusion

The exercises in this module provide a practical introduction to programming with JavaScript, covering essential concepts such as loops, functions, and recursion. By engaging with these examples, learners can strengthen their foundational skills and gain confidence in their programming abilities.
